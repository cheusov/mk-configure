======================================================================
Version 0.25.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed,  1 Jan 2014 19:28:55 +0300

  Build infrastructure for mk-c itself was completely reimplemented.
  Now it looks much better and is more flexible for further extensions.

  NetBSD version of mkdep(1), traditional BSD mkdep(1) or
  makedepend(1) is needed at build time.

  LDCOMPILER defaults to "yes".

  Variable TARGETS is now visible to users and is documented. It
  contains all recursive targets and may be used for adding user's
  functionality to mk-c.

  FIX: Parallel installation ("mkcmake install -jN") now works
  correctly. "installdirs" is activated before "install". Report by
  Michael Crogan.

  During build object directories are created automatically by default
  when MAKEOBJDIR or MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX are set.  New recursive target
  "obj" and variable MKOBJDIRS were introduced.
  Report by Michael Crogan.

  New variable MKRELOBJDIR was introduced. With its help one can
  create object directories relative to top-level object directory
  (like MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX but without top-level ${.CURDIR} in paths).
  Thanks to Michael Crogan.

  target "depend":
     - FIX. Original implementation relied on NetBSD version of
       mkdep(1). So, it didn't work on Linux, FreeBSD and others with
       original BSD mkdep(1). Type of mkdep(1) is detected at
       mk-configure build time. Report by Michael Crogan.

  New variables LN, LN_S, MKDIR, RM, CLEANFILES_CMD, CLEANDIRS_CMD,
  UNINSTALL, MAKEDEPEND, OBJTOP, CC_PREFIX, CXX_PREFIX were
  introduced.

  New variable NODEPS was introduced. With its help one can cut off
  the dependency graph for particular targets.

  New variable BMAKE_REQD was introduced.

  New variable SRCTOP was introduced. With its help
     "mkcmake -C subdir target" may work just like "mkcmake target-subdir".

  New variables CFLAGS.dflt.${CC_TYPE} and CXXFLAGS.dflt.${CXX_TYPE}
    were introduced. They default to -Qunused-arguments
    for clang and clang++.

  mkc.init.mk can be invoked by users directly for setting all
  required variables and further checks (CC_TYPE, LD_TYPE, OPSYS etc.).

  mkc_imp.links.mk:
     - This module was reimplemented from scratch.
       Bug with parallel installation (LINKS and MLINKS) was fixed.

  mkc.minitest.mk:
     - new variable TEST_PREREQS was introduced.

  mkc_imp.inc.mk: fix for ${INCS} installation problem happened when
     headers are built in ${.OBJDIR}. Report by Jan Smydke.

  mkc_imp.info.mk:
     - fix for MKINSTALL=no. "installdirs" unexpectedly created target
       directories.

  mkc.configure.mk:
     - fix issue with MKC_CHECK_CUSTOM when ${.OBJDIR} != ${.CURDIR}
     - MKC_CHECK_PROGS: PROG.<prog> is set even if full path was
       specified.  In addition existence and executability of the
       specified file is always checked.
     - fix for MKC_SOURCE_FUNCLIBS. Not all objects were cleaned
       correctly by target "clean".  Now objects are added to CLEANFILES
       unconditionally.
     - negative results for MKC_REQUIRE_* are not cached.  This gives
       users ability to fix the problem by changing the environment
       and try again.
     - MKC_CHECK_BUILTINS. Additional builtin checks were added:
       "prog_mkdep" and "prog_nbmkdep" for original BSD mkdep(1) and
       NetBSD version of mkdep(1) respectively.

  mkc_imp.intexts.mk fixes:
     - Targets "clean" and "cleandir" do not fail anymore if INTEXTS_REPLS
       contains empty variables.
     - Target "all" works correctly if INFILES or INSCRIPTS contain
       files with directories.

  mkc.sub{dir,prj}.mk:
     - ${MAKEFLAGS} is passed to recursive ${MAKE}s.
     - {nodeps-,subdir-,}dir:T are also targets, that is, one can also
       use the last component of subdirectory as_a_part_of/as_a_whole
       target. If you want to disablethis set SHORTPRJNAME to "no".

  mkc_imp.subdir.mk was reimplemented using mkc_imp.subprj.mk

  mkc_imp.dep.mk:
     - documentation for this module was added.
     - support for SHRTOUT=yes
     - new variable DPSRCS was introduced
     - MKDEP_SUFFIXES also contains .os and .op. Report by Michael Crogan.
     - Target "clean" does not remove .depend and .d files.
       Target "cleandir" does. NetBSD mk files work the same way.
       Report by Michael Crogan.

  MKPIE/SHLIB_*:
     - s/-KPIC/-xcode=pic32/ for SunStudio compilers

  MKSSP=yes:
     - Support for IBM XL Compiler was added (not tested due to lack of such iron)
     - Support for Intel C/C++ Compiler was added

  Documentation fixes, updates and improvements.  A lot of new
  examples/. A lot of new regression tests.

  Tools:
     Long option --help was removed from all utilities
     - mkc_install:
        - fix for problem with parallel "installdirs" (race condition).
        - Options -t and -b were removed.
     - mkc_check_prog: option -i is documented in man page
     - mkc_check_compiler: workarounds for buggy SunStudio C++
       compiler ("CC -E -" exits with error).

  All test are run with MKCATPAGES=no by default.

  myprojects.pdf: pipestatus also uses mk-configure.

======================================================================
Version 0.24.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri,  8 Mar 2013 13:18:00 +0300

  mkc.sub{dir,prj}.mk:
    - support for subprojects containing / symbol was added. In
      OBJDIR_<dir> variable slashes are replaced with underlines.
      In addition OBJDIR_<dir:T> variable is set.
    - now also run the target "errorcheck"
    - now work correctly with non-empty MAKEOBJDIR
      and MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX.

  Minor improvements in examples/*/linkme.mk

  DPLIBS is deprecated, use LDADD instead.

  ${MKC_SOURCE_FUNCLIBS}.o is added to CLEANFILES if it is set.

  Minor fixes in mkc_imp.lua.mk (LUA_MODULES vs. LUA_LMODULES).

  Some improvements and fixes in man page and FAQ.
  Thanks to Jeremy Reed, Min Sik Kim and Jan Smydke.

======================================================================
Version 0.23.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 22 Jul 2012 14:06:06 +0300

  mkc.subprj.mk:
    - Support for "virtual" subproject was added. Subprojects listed
      in SUBPRJ and SUBPRJS_DFLT are not necessarily associated with
      a subdirectory. See examples/hello_superfs for example.
      Virtual subproject is a way to group several subprojects into
      new one.

  New variables were introduced: COPTS_<proj> OBJCOPTS_<proj>
  LDADD_<proj> LDFLAGS_<proj> CPPFLAGS_<proj> CXXFLAGS_<proj>.
  See the manual page for details.

  Fix: OBJDIR_<subdir> variables now always contain full paths.

  Fix in mkc_which(1). Now it differs directories and regular files.

  Minor fixes in regression tests for EXPORT_SYMBOLS.

  mkc.lib.mk:
    - SHLIB_MINOR unconditionally defaults to 0

  More slides in .pdf presentation:
    - cross-compilation
    - EXPORT_SYMBOLS

  Fixes for Pascal support

  Minor fixes in the man page

======================================================================
Version 0.22.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri,  9 Mar 2012 20:26:34 +0300

  Improvements in cross-compilation. The following variables were
     introduced: TOOLDIR, SYSROOT, TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX and
     MACHINE_GNU_PLATFORM.

  PROGS variable was introduced (sf.net bug #3445658).

  Support for Lua submodules was added (e.g. net.socket.lua ->
  net/socket.lua). New variable LUA_MODULES was introduced for this
  purpose.

  MKPIE (Position Independent Executables), USE_SSP (Stack Smashing
  Protection), USE_FORT and USE_RELRO variables were introduced for
  security reasons.

  Variable OBJDIR_<dir> was introduced.

  mkc.subdir.mk and mkc.subprj.mk: Commands associated with targets
  "all", "install", "clean", "cleandir", "depend", "test",
  "installdirs", "uninstall", "errorcheck" and "filelist" in Makefile
  override the standard behaviour.

  MKC_REQUIRE_HEADERS, MKC_REQUIRE_DEFINES, MKC_REQUIRE_TYPES,
  MKC_REQUIRE_VARS, MKC_REQUIRE_MEMBERS, MKC_REQUIRE_FUNCS<n> and
  MKC_REQUIRE_CUSTOM do not change CFLAGS.

  mkc.subdir.mk and mkc.subprj.mk: "cleandir" target takes into
  account CLEANFILES, CLEANDIRS, DISTCLEANFILES and DISTCLEANDIRS
  variables (removes files).

  PCNAME.<lib> variable was introduced in mkc_imp.pkg-config.mk, this
  is a map from library name to pcname (.pc).

  Improvements for SHRTOUT.

  New variable OBJCOPY was introduced.

  Update of the presentation.

  Fix in manual page (sf.net bug #3441610).

  New regression tests (examples).

======================================================================
Version 0.21.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 22 Oct 2011 01:50:05 +0300

  mkc_check_compiler has been reimplemented. This fixes problems
  on system with /bin/sh == bash (affected versions: 0.21.1)
  and makes it drammatically faster.

======================================================================
Version 0.21.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue, 13 Sep 2011 11:28:26 +0300

  Target "errorcheck" ("configure") cannot work in parallel.

  Fix bug appeared in parallel builds (make -j).
     Thanks to Alexander Nasonov.

  Support for IRIX64 and Haiku was implemented.

  PDF presentation update

  Minor clean-ups

======================================================================
Version 0.21.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 24 Oct 2010 17:47:19 +0300

  Support for clang compiler was implemented.

  Documentation and presentation were updated. There are new projects
  using mk-configure.

  mkc_install is always used for installing mk-configure.
  This simplifies an installation process on non-BSD platforms.

  WARNS variable: support for icc was added.

  New variable LEXLIB library responsible for -ll/-lfl was introduced.
  See examples/hello_calc2.

  mkc_check_compiler: in order to differentiate icc from gcc, a check
  for Intel C/C++ compiler is run first.

  New target "filelist" that outputs a list of files for the whole
  project was introduced.

  Makefile: mk-configure's mk files are unconditionally installed to
  its own directory in order to avoid potential conflicts with
  system-wide sys.mk on BSD platforms.

  mkc.configure.mk: HAVE_FUNCLIB.main is always set to  1.
  mkc_check_funclibs is not run for checking presense of function
  "main" in libc.

  New variable MKCHECKS was introduced.

  Useless rule ".sh:" was removed.

======================================================================
Version 0.20.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 19 Sep 2010 21:46:25 +0300

  New variable PROJECTNAME, see the manual page.

  New variable EXPORT_DYNAMIC for making all symbols in executable
  visible to linked or dlopen'ed libraries. It is supported on *BSD,
  Linux, SunOS, QNX, Interix, OSF1, HP-UX.

  New variable CFLAGS.pic. See the manual page.

  EXPORT_SYMBOLS: On systems using GNU ld, i.e. *BSD, Linux, QNX
     etc. 'ld --version-script' is used in order to specify a list of
     exported symbols instead of --retain-symbols-file

  Lua support:
     - Lua support didn't work properly if only one of LUA_LMODULES or
       LUA_CMODULE were specified. Now it is fixed.
     - New regression test examples/hello_lua2.
     - Force building Lua modules with .so extension.

  Darwin:
     - support for EXPORT_SYMBOLS was added
     - DLLs (MKDLL=yes) are built as bundles and have .bundle extension

  /usr/bin/install is used as INSTALL only on *BSD platforms.  On all
  others mkc_install is used.

  Interix:
     - 775:664 permissions are used only for +Administrator user.
     - "installdirs" target creates directories with 775 permission if
       needed.

  OSF1:
     - better handling the so_location files.

  mkc_imp.arch.mk:
     - PROJECTNAME variable is used for creating archives and .deb
       package.

======================================================================
Version 0.19.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri,  3 Sep 2010 23:19:44 +0300

  FIX: LPREFIX, YPREFIX and YHEADER now works as
  documented. Regression test for them is added.

  As of this release target "install" creates target directories by
  default, i.e. it envokes target "installdirs" before installing
  files. For disabling this behaviour, you may set MKINSTALLDIRS
  variable to "no".

  mkc.lib.mk:
    - New variable EXPORT_SYMBOLS for exporting (in shared object
      library) only specified symbols. At the moment the following
      platforms support this: Solaris and those using GNU ld,
      that is *BSD and Linux.
    - "ld -h" is enabled on Solaris.

  mkc.subdir.mk and mkc.subprj.mk:
    - Two new variables: EXPORT_VARNAMES and NOEXPORT_VARNAMES for
      exporting variables before building subprojects. By default
      MKC_CACHEDIR is exported. As a result _mkc_* cache files will
      be placed in one directory for all subprojects.
    - New variable NOSUBDIR for excluding specified subprojects from
      build. Useful side effect: by using this variable you may
      disable some regression tests while running "bmake test".
    - Makefile.rec file if present is included by ALL subprojects
      recursively. See tests/rec_makefiles.

  mkc.subprj.mk:
    - New target subdir-<trg>-<subdir>, synonym for
      nodeps-<trg>-<subdir>.

  mkc.configure.mk:
    - MKC_CHECK_PROGS: mkc_check_progs is not called if path to
      program is absolute.

  mk-configure.7 shows in <> typical place where variables shall be used.

  On Solaris LD=/usr/ccs/bin/ld by default.
  On OSF1 LD=/usr/bin/ld by default.
  On QNX mkc_install is used as install program by default.

  mkc_check_custom:
    - FIXED: ambiguous arguments of command "test" (seen on QNX)

  regression tests:
    - New test examples/hello_plugins replacing
      examples/hello_dlopen and examples/hello_dll
    - New test examples/hello_calc

======================================================================
Version 0.18.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue, 27 Jul 2010 21:06:56 +0300

  Several new variables are introduced:
    - LUA_LMODDIR and LUA_CMODDIR - installation directories
      for Lua modules written in Lua and C.
    - MKC_VERSION is now documented.
    - MLINKS now works just like in NetBSD.
    - CFLAGS.warns.<cctype>.<warn-level> and
      CXXFLAGS.warns.<cctype>.<warn-level> are now documented.
      Feel free to set them in sys.mk before installation.
    - WARNERR for forcing warnings to be reported as errors.

  New targets are introduced: bin_tar, bin_targz, bin_tarbz2,
     bin_zip and bin_deb for creating archive files or .deb
     package containing an installation image (Ex:
     examples/hello_files).  This also introduces new variables: TAR,
     GZIP, BZIP2 and ZIP.

  Documentation:
    - Just a few notes about cross-compilation in mk-configure.7
    - New slides, fixes and improvements in doc/presentation.pdf
    - README: feel free to edit sys.mk before installation
    - README: a few notes about tools used for development.

  Support for POD (Plain Old Documentation) is added
    (.pod.1, ..., .pod.9 and .pod.html suffix rules).
    New variables for this: POD2MAN, POD2MAN_FLAGS, POD2HTML
    and POD2HTML_FLAGS. Ex: examples/hello_xxzip

  ../Makefile.inc is included automatically if exists just like
      in NetBSD. Ex: hello_superfs.

  .ORDER: installdirs install. This should fix -j<N> problem.
     Thanks to FreeBSD buys,
     swell.k at gmail.com and Mikolaj Golub

  WARNS: add support for HP-UX C/C++

  all:${FILES} ${MAN} etc. for the case when FILES are generated.
     Thanks to Jan Smydke.

  New examples (regression tests): hello_superfs, hello_xxzip.

======================================================================
Version 0.17.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue, 22 Jun 2010 23:44:08 +0300

  mkc_imp.pkg-config.mk:
    - FIXED: double applying -L, -l and -I options got from pkg-config.
      Solution: .unset PKG_CONFIG_DEPS
    - Additional checks for INSTALL_{C,L}MOD pkg-config variables,
      they must be defined.

  CC_TYPE, CXX_TYPE and LD_TYPE variables are a part of mk-c's API,
  now they are documented.

  mkcmake:
    - MKC_BMAKE environment variable is introduced. See mkcmake.1

  Documentation for /etc/mk.conf, @sysconfdir@/mk.conf and MAKECONF.

  doc/presentation.pdf: New slides and updates

  FAQ: updates

  mkc_imp.lua.mk:
    - Check for lua.h header if other checks succeeded.

  mkc_imp.lib.mk:
    - MKDLL is also case-insensitive.

  Makefile:
    - make shipped with NetBSD-5 does not have option -C,
      so I remove it.

======================================================================
Version 0.16.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 12 Jun 2010 15:06:10 +0300

  Support for Lua programming language. See documentation for
  mkc_imp.lua.mk in mk-configure(7).

  mkc.pkg-config.mk:
    - Significant improvements! For details see
      mk-configure(7) manual page and examples/hello_glib2 example.
      New supported variables: PKG_CONFIG.exists.<lib>, PKG_CONFIG_VARS.<lib>
      and PKG_CONFIG.var.<lib>.<var>.
    - becomes internal include file and therefore
      renamed to mkc_imp.pkg-config.mk.  Symlink mkc.pkg-config.mk is
      provided for backward compatibility.  mkc_imp.pkg-config.mk is
      included by mkc.prog.mk and mkc.lib.mk.

  mkc.intexts.mk:
    - becomes internal include file and therefore
      renamed to mkc_imp.intexts.mk.
      Symlink mkc.intexts.mk is provided for backward compatibility.
      It is included from mkc.prog.mk, mkc.lib.mk and mkc.files.mk.
    - New variable INTEXTS_REPLS. See mk-configure(7).

  mkc.lib.mk:
    - includes mkc_imp.intexts.mk
    - supports SCRIPTS* variables (includes newly created mkc_imp.scripts.mk)
    - New variable MKDLL for creating dinamically loaded libraries (<lib>.so).

  mkc_imp.subprj.mk:
    - New variable SUBPRJ_DFLT. See mk-configure(7).

  mkc.*.mk try to open ${MAKECONF}, @sysconfdir@/mk.conf and /etc/mk.conf.
  This is now documented.

  mk-configure.7 is reorganized. Several internal include files
  document their own variables.  Further improvements of man page are
  needed.

  All boolean variables becomes case-insensitive.
  That is "no", "No", "NO" and "nO" are equal.
  The same for "yes", "Yes"...

  mkc_check_custom(1):
    - New options: -p, -n, -m and -s.

  Minor fixes and clean-ups in .mk files, tools and regression tests.

  New regression tests and examples.

======================================================================
Version 0.15.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 28 May 2010 22:39:36 +0300

  FIX: in version 0.15.0 mkc.subprjs.mk was added, but it was not
      installed because I forgot to add it to Makefile. Now it is
      installed just like all other *.mk files.

  FIX: 'all : errorcheck' is not for bsd.subdir.mk and bsd.subprj.mk

  mkc.subprjs.mk has been renamed to mkc.subprj.mk.
  mkc.subprjs.mk is installed as a symlink.

======================================================================
Version 0.15.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue, 25 May 2010 22:52:28 +0300

  New presentation for mk-configure is in doc/ subdirectory.

  New top-level include file "mkc.subprjs.mk", more powerful
  replacement for mkc.subdir.mk. It handles subprojects organized as a
  dependency graph.

  New variables are added: MKPICLIB, MKSHLIB, MKSTATICLIB and
  MKPROFILELIB for building PIC, shared, static and profile libraries.
  See mk-configure.7 for details.

  MKPIC, MKPROFILE and MKPICINSTALL variables are removed. Use
  MKPICLIB, MKSHLIB, MKPROFILELIB and MKINSTALL variables instead.

  Implementation for variable "WARNS" (currently only for gcc).

  New variable "SHRTOUT". If it is not "no", shortened formatted
  messages are output about compiling, linking etc.

  Manual page for mkcmake(1).

  Target "depend" is added for generating .depend file.

  Minor fixes in mkc_check_funclib.

  Support for Cygwin is added (no support for shared libraries yet).

  Clean-ups in target "clean".

  More regression tests and examples.

  Minor fix in mkc_imp.subdir.mk: do not run "installdirs" if MKINSTALL=no.

  Internal target "error-check" is renamed to "errorcheck".

======================================================================
Version 0.14.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 31 Jan 2010 16:37:21 +0200

  Support for OSF1. Tested on Tru64-5.1/alpha with gcc and DEC C
  compiler.

  Support for DragonFlyBSD. Tested on DragonFlyBSD-2.4.1/x86 with gcc.

  Support for MirOS BSD. Tested on MirBSD-10/x86 with gcc.

  SHLIBMODE variable is introduced which sets a shared library mode.

  FIX: mkc.subdir.mk now takes into account MKINSTALL variable.
  Thanks to Mikolaj Golub for pointing out.

  FIX: targets "installdirs" and "uninstall" now takes into account
  MKINSTALL variable.

  fix in mkc.minitest.mk: HP-UX's diff doesn't have -u flag, so I
  remove it.

  fix in mkc_imp.platform.sys.mk: CC/CXX type should be detected AFTER
  setting CC/CXX variables.

  mkc_check_compiler:
     - support for DEC C compiler (OSF1/Tru64)
     - minor fixes.

  More regression tests.

======================================================================
Version 0.13.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 27 Dec 2009 17:06:06 +0200

  CC, CXX and LD types are automatically detected and options passed
  to them (e.g. options for generating a position independent code or
  options for building a shared library) depend on this type.
  At the moment the following systems and compilers are supported:

      - NetBSD. Tested under NetBSD-5.0/x86 and NetBSD-2.0/alpha with
        gcc and pcc (Portable C compiler).

      - FreeBSD. Tested under FreeBSD-6.2/x86, 7.1/spark64 and 7.1/x86
        with gcc.

      - OpenBSD. Tested under OpenBSD-3.8/x86 and 4.5/x86 with gcc.

      - Solaris. Tested under Solaris-10/x86 and Solaris-10/spark64
        with sunpro-11, sunpro-12 and gcc.

      - Darwin (MacOS-X). Tested under Darwin-8.11.0/ppc (MacOS-X
        Tiger) with native gcc.

      - Interix. Tested under Interix-3.5/x86 with gcc.

      - QNX. Tested under QNX-6.3/x86 with gcc.

      - Partial support for AIX, HP-UX and Tru64 and their native
        compilers and linkers. Support is not complete because I have
        no access to "big iron". Any help? ;-)

      If you don't see your favourite system/compiler here and want to
      help me to improve mk-configure, feel free to contact
      me. mk-configure needs your help! ;-)

  The default directory for mk-files is ${PREFIX}/share/mkc-mk, where
  an empty sys.mk is installed unless NOSYSMK is defined while
  installation.  See an explanation about this in README.

  So called built-in checks are implemented. See MKC_CHECK_BUILTINS
  variable. Built-in checks are checks provided by mk-configure. At
  the moment the following checks are implemented: endianess,
  prog_flex, prog_bison, prog_gawk, prog_gm4. See mk-configure.7 for
  the documentation.

  mkc.configure.mk:
    - At the end of this file MKC_{REQUIRE,CHECK}_XXX variables as
      well as MKC_{CFLAGS,LDADD,SRCS} are .undef-ed. This allows one
      to .include mkc.configure.mk several times.
    - This include file is activated automatically from mkc.prog.mk
      and mkc.lib.mk. You need to .include mkc.configure.mk
      explicitely only if postcheck actions are needed.

  SCRIPTS variable can contain subdir/<script>s, they are installed
  just as <script>s, i.e. subdir/ is silently stripped.
  SCRIPTSDIR_subdir_<script> and SCRIPTSNAME_subdir_<script> can be
  used for specifying an alternative destination path and filename.

  If .l or .y source files are listed in SRCS variable, mk-configure
  automatically checks weather ${LEX} and ${YACC} are available or
  not.  The same for .c/${CC}, .cpp|.cc|.cxx|.C/${CXX}, .f/${FC} and
  .p/${PC}.  In case of absense of appropriate tool bmake exits with
  error on early stage.

  MKC_CHECK_CUSTOM, MKC_REQUIRE_CUSTOM:
    - HAVE_CUSTOM.xxx bmake's variables and HAVE_CUSTOM_xxx #defines
      have been renamed to CUSTOM.xxx and CUSTOM_xxx respectively.
      Formally speaking this breaks backward compatibility with
      earlier mk-c releases.
    - Support for checks written in C++ (.cc, .cxx, .C and .cpp) and
      Fortran (.f) is added.
    - Support for checks implemented as an executable program/script is added.

  FIXES:
    - mkc_imp.man.mk: useless TMACDIR and dependencies on tmac files
      under /usr/share are removed
    - mkc_check_decl:
      void function() cannot 'return 0' (thanks to SunPro compiler!)
    - If C++ source files are listed in SRCS, ${CXX} is used as a
      linker both for executables and shared libraries.
    - Linux, SunOS and lots of others have no "wheel" group.  They use
      "root".
    - "make installdirs" should not create man/htmlN directories
      unless MKHTML is set to "yes"
    - mkc_imp.lib.mk: .so build rule must use ${LDFLAGS}

  ADDED: mkcmake utility (trivial wrapper over bmake) which should be
  used for building a software instead of bmake.

  .c:, .f:, .l: and similar useless rules are removed. It is enough to
  have .c.o:, .f.o:, .l.c etc.

  Improvements for cross-compilation.

  Lots of new regression tests:

  mkc_check_common.sh:
    if MKC_NOCACHE=1, tmp.c, tmp.o, tmp.exe and tmp.err are
    removed.

  Support for lex:
    -ll is added to linker if needed.

  mkc_check_compiler:
    - Added support for the following compilers: IBM Visual Age, HP
      cc/aCC, SunPro C/C++, Watcom, Borland, DEC C/C++ and Comeau C/C++
    - New option '-x' for checking C++ compiler type.

  mkc_which:
    Accepts full paths. /path/to/program -> /path/to/program

  In order to avoid confusion, position independent object files (.so)
  have been renamed to .os. Also, .po has been renamed to .op.

  mkc_imp.lib.mk:
    - suffix rules for .cpp, widely used extension for C++ sources, are
      added.
    - LDCOMPILER variable is introduced, if "yes", compiler is used
      for linking a shared library.

  INCSSRCDIR variable is introduced, see the documentation.

  mkc_install: New utility for platforms having no BSD compatible
  install(1). INSTALL variable is set to mkc_install if needed.

  mkc.intexts.mk is included from mkc.prog.mk and mkc.lib.mk
  automatically just like mkc_imp.*.mk includes.

Version 0.12.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 12 Nov 2009 17:58:09 +0200

  mk-configure doesn't depend on external pkgsrc-mk-files anymore!
  The only required thing is bmake itself.  Everything else is inside
  mk-configure tarball now (yes, I've forked mk-files. Lots of fixes,
  clean-ups, reorganizations, additions, improvements, removals of
  useless code...). Some interesting things were stolen from NetBSD
  base system's mk-files.  Do not rely on things you found in
  NetBSD/pkgsrc/sjg mk-files or even mk-c sources! Only features
  documented in mk-configure.7 will be supported.

  A target "install-dirs" has been renamed to "installdirs".
  Ask mkc.subdir.mk why ;-)

  mkc.lib.mk:
    - Commands for building a .so/.dylib shared library
      is overridable by user (using bmake's "commands").

  Shared libraries
    - support for Darwin (.dylib and Apple's ld)
    - support for Solaris (gcc + Solaris' ld)
    - support for shared libraries is still terrible, more flexibility
      is needed.

  Variables:
    - New variables CLEANDIRS and DISTCLEANDIRS.
    - As of this release MKC_SHOW_CACHED defaults to 0.
    - New variable MKINSTALL. You can use it for internal static libraries.
    - New variable MKC_REQD. Minimal mk-configure version required. If
      this check fails, an entire build fails.
    - New variable USETBL. NOTE: It is "yes"/"no" variable.
    - New variable MANZ. NOTE: It is "yes"/"no" variable.
    - New variable SCRIPTSBIN that defaults to ${BINDIR}.
    - HTMLDIR is introduced containing directry for .html pages
      generated from manual pages. html pages are automatically
      installed if MKHTML=yes.
    - LDLIBS is not used anymore. Use LDADD for libraries.
    - DISTCLEANFILES modifyable by user contains a list of files
      removed by targets "cleandir" and "distdir"
    - New variable NROFF_MAN2DOC.

  Fixes:
    - A target "uninstall" now works correctly with .cat files.
    - configure.mk
      Workaround for buggy 20081111 < bmake < 20090909.
      See NetBSD BTS bin/41998:
          /usr/bin/make: .for loop + ":" inside iter_var = bug

  mk-configure:
    - "make distclean" run at the root mk-c's directory really removes
      all garbage.
    - TONS OF NEW REGRESSION TESTS. If you are running an exotic platform,
      run "bmake test" and send me results ;-)

  mkc_check_prog (MKC_CHECK_PROG):
    - Path to a found program is output instead of just "found" message.

  mkc_check_compiler - new utility, not used in mkc.*.mk yet.

======================================================================
Version 0.11.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat,  5 Sep 2009 17:25:18 +0300

  fixed: path to awk in mkc_check_version script

======================================================================
Version 0.11.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat,  5 Sep 2009 15:26:01 +0300

  mk-configure(7)

  Simon Gerrary's mk-files is not supported anymore.
  Use pkgsrc mk-files!

  Regression tests have been reorganized and significantly improved.
  All examples become regression tests.  Lots of new tests.
  Run 'bmake test' to run them.

  mk-configure uses its own mkc.*.mk scripts to build and install
  itself.  As a result Free/OpenBSD make cannot be used anymore for
  building and installations. Use bmake!

  ADDED: FAQ document to answer frequently asked questions.
  Thanks to Michael Shigorin for corrections.

  New simple module for regression tests: mkc.minitest.mk.  Besides
  its simplicity it is quite useful. mk-configure uses it for testing
  itself.

  Initial version of mkc.pkg-config.mk module
  See examples/hello_glib2 for the sample of use.
  Note that it is not complete yet.

  mkc.configure.mk and configure.mk:

      - checks are not run if appropriate HAVE_xxx.yyy variable is
        already defined. This makes possible to effectively build
        software in a well defined stable environment.
        Ex: bmake -f predefined_settings.mk -f Makefile all

      - ADDED: MKC_CHECK_TYPES for checking for types.
        See the documentation in configure.mk.in and examples/.

      - ADDED: MKC_CHECK_CUSTOM for custom user's checks.
        Custom check is a user's code.
        Check itself -- is this code compilable or not.
        See the documentation in configure.mk.in and examples/.

      - Behaviour of MKC_CHECK_MEMBERS changed: Now "struct " prefix
        is not hardcoded. This gives an ability to check members in
        struct-s, enum-s and typedef-s.

      - NEW: MKC_REQUIRE_HEADERS, MKC_REQUIRE_FUNCLIBS,
        MKC_REQUIRE_DEFINES, MKC_REQUIRE_TYPES, MKC_REQUIRE_VARS,
        MKC_REQUIRE_MEMBERS, MKC_REQUIRE_CUSTOM and
        MKC_REQUIRE_FUNCS<N>.  If these checks failure, bmake exits
        with error and prints an error message.  See configure.mk.in
        for the documentation and examples/ for the samples of use.

      - NEW: MKC_CHECK_PROGS and MKC_REQUIRE_PROGS.
        See configure.mk.in for the documentation and
        examples/ for the samples of use.

      - NEW: targets "distclean" and "cleandir" removes _mkc_* cache files.

      - NEW: target "configure" runs all checks
        and creates _mkc_ cache files.

      - all checks are disabled for targets "clean", "cleandir" and
        "distclean".

      -  Cache file names changed. Now they are:
           _mkc_type_<type>, _mkc_sizeof_<type>, _mkc_header_<header>,
           _mkc_funclib_<funclib>, _mkc_funcN_<func>,
           _mkc_variable_<variable>, _mkc_custom_<custom-check>,
           _mkc_prog_<progname>, _mkc_define_<define>, _mkc_member_<member>

  mkc.info.mk and mkc.man.mk are removed. They are included automatically
  from mkc.prog.mk, mkc.lib.mk and mkc.files.mk if needed.

  mkc.prog.mk, mkc.lib.mk, mkc.files.mk and mkc.subdir.mk:

      - NEW: target "uninstall" is supported.

      - performance improvements. "Hard" sections of mkc.common.mk are
      activated if and only if appropriate target is in action.

      - FIX: target "install-dirs" now works correctly with MAN
      containing .N pages where N is not 1.

      - FIX: target "install-dirs" now takes into account LINKS and
        SYMLINKS.

      - Better support for TEXINFO:
          - "uninstall" target takes TEXINFO into account.
          - "clean" target removes generated .info files.

      - mkc.{prog,lib,files}.mk supports a target "test".  By default
        it does nothing.  The target "test" of mkc.subdir.mk runs
        'bmake test' for each SUBDIR. If you want to define your own
        "test" target overriding the default one, define it in your
        project's Makefile before any .include <mkc.*.mk> directive.

      - MKC_REQD variable

  Makefile of mk-configure: README, NEWS, TODO, FAQ and LICENSE
  files are also installed unless EXTRAFILES is set to an empty string.

  "mkc_check_sizeof" and "mkc_check_decl type" don't create cache
  files with spaces in its name anymore.  Space inside a filename is
  replaced with symbol ~ (tilde).

  FIXED: mkc_check_custom, mkc_check_decl, mkc_check_funclib,
  mkc_check_header and mkc_check_sizeof failed if CC contains space.
  Thanks to Vitaly Lipatov for the report.

  mkc_check_sizeof now works drammatically faster.

  MKHTML defaults to "no".

  mkc_check_sizeof, mkc_check_custom:
      - fixes for problems with Solaris' /bin/sh

  Other fixes and improvements.

======================================================================
Version 0.10.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 31 May 2009 14:54:10 +0300

  mkc.configure.mk:

      New: MKC_CHECK_MEMBERS, mechanism for checking for structure
      members. Regression tests for this new feature. Man page update
      for mkc_check_decl. See the documentation for MKC_CHECK_MEMBERS
      in configure.mk file.

      Fix: HAVE_FUNCN.funcname.dir.header_h ->
           HAVE_FUNCN.funcname.dir_header_h
      New: Support for HAVE_VAR.varname.dir_header_h (dir/header.h!)
      New: Support for HAVE_DEFINE.defname.dir_header.h (dir/header.h!)
      New: MKC_COMMON_DEFINES.`uname -s`, e.g. MKC_COMMON_DEFINES.NetBSD,
           MKC_COMMON_DEFINES.Linux etc.

  "install-dirs" now work fully correctly, i.e. creates
  all required directories.

  New variable DPLIBS for listing -llibs for linking. Use DPLIBS
  instead of LDADD for linking with local libraries.
  See examples/8/hello/Makefile.

  mkc_check_decl:
     workaround for buggy ksh and FreeBSD /bin/sh.

======================================================================
Version 0.9.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 29 Mar 2009 16:53:57 +0300

  Huge amount of changes were made since previous release.  Now
  mk-configure provides a number of mkc.*.mk scripts working on top of
  pkgsrc's mk files or Simon Gerraty's mk-files and therefore provides
  a replacement not only for GNU autoconf but for GNU automake too.
  It makes sense to reread README file.
  Lots of new information is there.

  Lots of examples (yes, hello_worlds applications :-) ) were created
  in examples/ subdirectory.

  Lots of new mkc.*.mk files were added. They work on top of bsd.*.mk
  files and provide new functions. See README.

  Regression tests were added. Thanks to them a number of bugs were
  detected and fixed.

  Fixes in configure.mk:
     - s/return/exit/ in ${.OBJDIR}/.error-check section.
       This bug is seen under Linux/bash.

     - bmake's variable SIZEOF.long_long was not set correctly
       (long-long din't work)

     - MKC_CHECK_SIZEOF+=type:header.h
       bmake's variable SIZEOF.<type>.<header_h> is set
       instead of plain SIZEOF.<type>

     - MKC_CHECK_HEADERS += dir/hdr.h
       bmake's variable: s/HAVE_HEADER.dir.hdr_h/HAVE_HEADER.dir_hdr_h/
       (`.' vs. `_')
       I hope this is a last change in configure.mk's API.

  My own mkc.intexts.mk bmake module (mk file).

  configure.mk:
    If CHECK_SIZEOF_xxx check fails, MKC_CFLAGS is not changed.  Only
    sucessful data type sizes are registered in MKC_CFLAGS and CFLAGS.

  mkc_check_decl, mkc_check_sizeof: they don't use MKC_COMMON_DEFINES
  environment enymore, everything should be passed through CFLAGS and
  CPPFLAGS.

  MKC_SHELL is currently disabled

======================================================================
Version 0.7.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 15 Mar 2009 11:02:29 +0200

  No CFLAGS+=-DHAVE_XXXX=0 anymore, if XXX is not found
  it is not defined at all. autoconf works the same way.

  mkc_check_xxx scripts:
      - installed to bin/ directory just like normal scripts.

      - if MKC_VERBOSE variable is equal to '1', verbose messages
        are output to stderr.

      - -h|--help options printing usage information.

      - manual pages are created.

  new variable MKC_NOCACHE, if it is set to not empty string,
  caching is disabled.

  fix in mkc_check_decl: long-long is treated as 'long long'.

  MKC_SHOW_CACHED, MKC_VERBOSE, MKC_DELETE_TMPFILES, MKC_NOCACHE
  variables: 1 - true, other values - false.

  minor clean-ups in Makefile

======================================================================
Version 0.6.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  8 Mar 2009 19:35:13 +0200

  MKC_FUNCLIBS_NOAUTO.ftime.compat is replaced
  with MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS list.

     Ex.:
       MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS += ftime:compat crypt:crypt
       MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS = 1 # for disabling
                               # all potential LDADD += ...

  fix: "checking for..." messages is now sent to stderr
  before result is calculated, not after.

  Support for heirloom-sh and ancient Solaris-10 /bin/sh

  added: MKC_SHELL variable defaulting to /bin/sh, mkc_check_XXX
  scripts are run with with this shell. This is variable is mainly for
  testing purposes but who knows.

======================================================================
Version 0.5.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue,  3 Mar 2009 00:04:52 +0200

   Huge amount of changes. 0.5.0 is completely incompatible with 0.4.0
   because 0.4.0 was proof-of-concept only ;-) Everything was
   inspired by discussion in fido7.ru.unix.prog.

   Changing in API is also possible in the future until
   I stabilize it.

======================================================================
Version 0.4.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 21 Feb 2009 22:47:20 +0200

   First publicly available release. Happy birth day! :-)
